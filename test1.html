    Investment Overview
   </div>
  </div>
  <br>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;">To: <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Jason da Costa</span></p>
  <br>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;">Thank you so much for your interest in investing in 3Fin Analytics. Your investment will be made by way of a SeedFAST.</p>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;">This section provides an overview of your investment. This is only an overview and does not form part of your legal agreement. The legal part of the agreement and the terms of your investment follow on subsequent pages.</p>
  <h3 style="font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;margin:0;text-transform:uppercase;">What is a SeedFAST?</h3>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;">A SeedFAST is an advanced subscription agreement ("ASA") that allows investors to make an investment now which will convert into shares in the next funding round at a valuation to be determined in that round.</p>
  <h3 style="font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;margin:0;text-transform:uppercase;">About your investment</h3>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;">You’re investing £20,000 in 3Fin Analytics, which will convert into shares when we do our next funding round.</p>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;">If we raise at least £650,000 (which excludes any amounts raised before then by way of SeedFASTs, convertible securities or advanced subscriptions) over one or more bona fide funding rounds before 1 April 2024, that will count as a new funding round.</p>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;">If we have a new funding round or sell the company before 1 April 2024, your investment will convert into shares at a valuation that’s the lower of:</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type:none;margin:0;padding:0;counter-reset:lrcnt;">
   <li style="margin:1em 0;display:table;width:100%;">a discount of 10% applied to the pre-money valuation offered to new investors in the new funding round, and</li>
   <li style="margin:1em 0;display:table;width:100%;">£3,150,000 (so that if we raise at a higher valuation than £3,500,000, then your investment will still convert as if the valuation was £3,150,000).</li>
  </ol>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;"></p>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;">To protect your investment, in the event that there is no new funding round before 1 April 2024, then on 1 April 2024 (or if the company is liquidated, dissolved, wound up, goes into administration or enters into a scheme of arrangement, prior to such an event) your investment will convert into shares at a valuation of £3,150,000.</p>
  <h3 style="font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;margin:0;text-transform:uppercase;">Next steps</h3>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;">Please carefully read the Advanced Subscription Agreement below. If you're happy with the terms please sign the document and we will do the same, then please wire your funds to the bank account as detailed in the Advanced Subscription Agreement below. Keep a copy of the Advanced Subscription Agreement for your records. That's it for now. The company will notify you when it's time to review the documents for their next funding round and for your investment to convert into shares.</p>
  <br>
  <p style="margin:1em 0;"><span style="font-style:italic;">The above summary is designed to provide an overview of your investment and isn’t legally binding. The Advanced Subscription Agreement is intended to be legally binding. If there's any difference in meaning or interpretation between this summary and the Advanced Subscription Agreement below, the terms of the Advanced Subscription Agreement prevail.</span></p>
